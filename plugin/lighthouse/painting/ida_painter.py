#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# MFF_NOWAIT Workaound
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#    due to the asynchronous nature of the database painter core, we need
#    to use IDA's execute_sync() with idaapi.MFF_WRITE to perform 'paint'
#    actions (which modify the database).
#
#     1. the first issue is that a deadlock can occur when attempting to use
#     execute_sync() with MFF_WRITE from a thread when IDA is in the process
#     of closing. This would occur when a paint was in progress, and the user
#     attempts to abruptly close the database.
#
#     the solution to this is to use the MFF_NOWAIT flag with MFF_WRITE, which
#     means execute_sync() is non-blocking. this avoids the deadlock that could
#     occur between the main thread and the async (painting) thread on close.
#
#     2. but prior to IDA 7.0 SP1, there was a bug with execute_sync() that
#     could cause IDA to abort() non-deterministically when using the
#     MFF_NOWAIT flag. The abort manifests as a hard-crash of IDA.
#
#    this is an issue that has haunted lighthouse since almost the beginning,
#    causing a number of compatibility/stability issues. the bug was fixed in
#    in IDA 7.0 SP1, but older versions of IDA are afflicted.
#
#    this section of code constitutes some of the most fragile, convoluted,
#    and regression prone code in lighthouse. through some miraculous feats
#    of engineering, the solution below appears to safely resolve both of
#    these problems for downlevel versions (IDA 6.8 --> 7.x)
